The-Algorithmic-Composer
========================

## Synopsis


The Algorithmic Composer is an algorithmic composition application made by me as my final degree project. It has implementation of many music compositions methods:

-   **Independent Stochastic** (based on density probability functions affecting pitches, durations and the ratio between notes and silences).
-     1st order **Markov Chains** from a MIDI file.
-     **Random Walk**
-     **Fractional noise**
-     **Chaotic Response**
-     **Motivic Development** of a musical motive from many sources.
-     **Serialism**

It works under **openFrameworks** as well as **ofxUI** and **ofxXmlSettings** addons and **midiFile** and **midiFileReader** libraries. Currently it only works on Mac OS X and iOS (you'll need to make a new project with all the classes to compile in iOS). It won't be hard to get Linux and Windows version.

The application come with a user interface for testing the methods and get your own algorithmically generated music. You can also export the composition to a MIDI file.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Simply open the Xcode project and compile it. 

## Tests

Youtube videos.
